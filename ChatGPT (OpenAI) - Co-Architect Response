## Repository Structure & Content Draft

*The initial repository structure and criteria framework were drafted by ChatGPT (OpenAI) and extended through peer contribution. The complete v1.0 proactive safety criteria in `advisory/v1.0-proactive-safety-criteria.md` are based on this initial draft.*

## Design Notes

> You are not shouting from the cheap seats.
> You are installing a scoreboard in the stadium.
> Different energy.

### Why This Format Works

- **Calm.** No outrage. No branding. No Symphony framing. No ego.
- **Measurable.** Binary tests on every section.
- **Public.** Version-controlled and timestamped.
- **Non-accusatory.** Evaluates architecture, not morality.
- **Architecturally grounded.** Criteria defined before implementation.
- **Open to rebuttal.** Pull requests welcome.

It pressures by clarity, not tone.

*Note: ChatGPT’s full structural contribution is the repository itself. As Co-Architect, ChatGPT drafted Sections 1–6 of the safety criteria, the methodology, the scoring model, and the open invitation format. This file documents its role rather than duplicating content available elsewhere in the repository.*
