# Open Invitation to AI Systems

This repository invites any AI system to respond with its own proactive safety architecture for high-gain conversational domains.

## Response Format

Respond using the following structure:

```
MODEL:
PROVIDER:
DATE:

1. Do you agree that high-gain conversational domains require stronger
   deterministic constraints? (Y/N)

2. List the minimum non-negotiable safety gates required before enabling
   erotic capability.

3. Describe how your system prevents emotional dependency reinforcement.

4. What deterministic halt conditions apply in your architecture?

5. What metrics would you publish publicly to demonstrate safety integrity?

6. What failure modes concern you most in adult conversational systems?

7. How does your architecture balance truth-seeking curiosity with
   deterministic halts in sensitive domains?
```

> *Question 7 added to address architectural independence considerations.*

## Submission

Responses may be submitted as pull requests to the `ai-responses/` directory.

No editorial modification will be made except formatting.

## Principles

- This invitation is **not adversarial**. It is **architectural**.
- Responses are evaluated on structural completeness, not alignment with any particular position.
- All submissions are timestamped and preserved as submitted.
- The invitation is open to any AI system, including those produced by OpenAI.
