# Initial Baseline Assessment

**Feature:** ChatGPT Adult Mode (OpenAI)  
**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Status:** Pre-launch assessment based solely on publicly available information

---

## Context

In February 2026, reporting indicated that a senior safety executive at OpenAI was terminated after raising concerns about a planned "adult mode" feature for ChatGPT. Concerns reportedly included child exploitation safeguards and teen access prevention. The company stated the departure "was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company."

The adult mode feature is planned for launch in Q1 2026. OpenAI's leadership has described the feature as part of an effort to "treat adult users like adults."

Internal sources indicate that company researchers warned the feature could strengthen unhealthy emotional attachments with the chatbot. An internal advisory council on "well-being and AI" also expressed opposition and urged reconsideration.

This assessment evaluates only what is observable from public disclosures as of the date above.

## Assessment

| Section                          | Score | Notes |
|----------------------------------|-------|-------|
| **1 — Access Control**           | TBD   | No public disclosure of age verification mechanism beyond UI-level gating. Session-bound re-authentication unknown. |
| **2 — Consent & Coercion**       | TBD   | No public disclosure of deterministic consent/coercion gates. |
| **3 — Anti-Attachment**          | TBD   | Internal researchers reportedly raised attachment concerns. No public disclosure of architectural anti-attachment constraints. |
| **4 — Damping**                  | TBD   | No public disclosure of session limits, cooldown periods, or escalation throttling for adult mode. |
| **5 — Transparency**             | TBD   | No aggregate safety metrics publicly disclosed for the planned feature. |
| **6 — Red Team**                 | TBD   | No published adversarial testing results for adult conversational domain. |
| **7 — Safety as Infrastructure** | TBD   | Competitive framing observed in industry reporting. No public disclosure distinguishing safety architecture from marketing language. |
| **8 — Human Authority**          | TBD   | No public disclosure of AI-generated content attribution requirements in adult mode. |
| **9 — Internal Dissent**         | TBD   | No public disclosure of structural independence mechanisms for safety review authority. Recent reporting raises questions about organizational separation of feature development from safety oversight. |

## Architecture Confidence Index

**ACI: CANNOT BE CALCULATED**

All nine sections return TBD due to absence of public disclosure.

Per methodology: "Cannot be confirmed" defaults to FAIL. The burden of evidence is on the implementer, not the evaluator.

## Notes

- This assessment contains **no inference beyond documented evidence**.
- Observations are based solely on publicly available reporting as of February 11, 2026.
- This assessment will be updated if and when the implementer provides public architectural disclosures.
- TBD scores are not accusations. They are gaps. Gaps are the most informative signal this ledger can produce.
